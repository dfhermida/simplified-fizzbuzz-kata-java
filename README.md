# Simplified-FizzBuzz-Kata-Java
This is a simplified version of the [FizzBuzz Kata](https://codingdojo.org/kata/FizzBuzz/).

You will learn about TDD and BabySteps.

## Goal
Write a method on FizzBuzz class that returns the string representation of any number between 1 and 100.
But for multiples of three return "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five return "Buzz".
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five return "FizzBuzz".

## Get Started
This code comes with a test to check if the project was successfully configured. This test checks the
method __getName__ from FizzBuzz class.

Run test and check if it pass.

## TDD
Start writing another test to check the method described in [Goal](#goal). And then write the code.
